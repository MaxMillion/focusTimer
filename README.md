jqTimer
=======

A very simple timer webapp

After spending a bunch of time playing with various timer apps on OS X,
I've been amazed to find that none of them both have the feature set
I want while also being both simple and easy to use.  

And I've been meaning to play with jQuery a bit more, so I coded up a
quick-n-dirty prototype.
