focusTimer
==========

A very simple timer application for focusing one's work.

After spending a bunch of time playing with various timer apps on OS X,
I've been amazed to find that none of them both have the feature set
I want while also being both simple and easy to use.  

I've been wanting to play with webby desktop apps (both fluid and chromeless,
in this case), jQuery-UI, and github more, so this is what I've come up with.
