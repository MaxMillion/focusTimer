Here's a quick-n-dirty writeup about how to use make a Fluid app of focusTimer.  It turns out that the open-source version of Fluid / Fluidium can't seem to allow the window to small enough, so now that chromeless is more mature than when I started this, I'm mostly focusing on them for the moment.

* download & install Fluid.app
* start Fluid.app
* fill out the page like this:

URL: http://focustimer.redpuma.net/
Name: focusTimer
Icon: http://focustimer.redpuma.net/time-tracker.png

* press the Create button
* after creation completes successfully, click the Launch Now button
* from the focusTimer menu, select Preferences

* Select Appearance, and make the following changes:

Window Style: HUD (Black)
Window Level: Floating
Window Opacity: somewhere near 75%

* click next, then select:

Spaces Behavior: Windows Appear in all Spaces
When this SSB is not frontmost: Windows are draggable from anywhere
