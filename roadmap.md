### ROADMAP

This is nominally a roadmap, but, really, it's just an evolving TODO list.
Anyone who wants to take a run at doing one of those these should feel free!

#### features      
  * for Widgetify: fold in jetpack notifications for temporary impl of HTML5 API
  * for Fluid: HTML5 or native Fluid
  * investigate simple notification audio
  
#### open-web (Chromeless/Widgetify) features we got for free from Fluid:
  * opacity of around 75%
  * make window always-on-top
  * make window appear in all spaces
  * explicit default height & width
  
#### misc features
  * add one-time snooze button
  * fade colors 

####  cleanup
  * port to commonjs module (for jetpack, chromeless use)
  * refactor away bad abstractions (use jQuery timer plugin?)
  * overhaul theme
  * update irregularly
  * get rid of one white pixel around input box
