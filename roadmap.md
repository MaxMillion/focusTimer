### ROADMAP

This is nominally a roadmap, but, really, it's just an evolving TODO list.
Anyone who wants to take a run at doing one of those these should feel free!

#### cleanup
  * explore react-style/famous/phonegap

#### features
  * make it work offline (ServiceWORKER)
  * explore bootstrap3
  * overhaul theme & fonts
  * consider transitions
  * review Fluid APIs
  * simple notification audio
  * implement cross-device timer using firebase

#### misc
  * add one-time snooze button
  * fade colors
  * add functional testing
  * play with Google closure compiler linting

#### open-web (WebRT) features we got for free from Fluid:
  * opacity of around 75%
  * make window always-on-top
  * make window appear in all spaces
  * explicit default height & width
