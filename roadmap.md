### ROADMAP

This is nominally a roadmap, but, really, it's just an evolving TODO list.
Anyone who wants to take a run at doing one of those these should feel free!

#### open web app features we got for free from Fluid:
  * explicit default height & width
  * opacity of around 75%
  * make window always-on-top
  * make window appear in all spaces
  
#### features      
  * investigate simple notification audio
  * for Fluid: HTML5 or native Fluid

#### misc features
  * add one-time snooze button
  * fade colors 
  * node server for shared timer?
  
####  cleanup
  * refactor away bad abstractions (use jQuery timer plugin?)
  * overhaul theme
  * update irregularly
  * get rid of one white pixel around input box
