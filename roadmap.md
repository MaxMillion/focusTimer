### ROADMAP

This is nominally a roadmap, but, really, it's just an evolving TODO list.
Anyone who wants to take a run at doing one of those these should feel free!

  * get rid of one white pixel around input box
  * TDD to Backbone

#### features      
  * explore new toolkits
  * overhaul theme & fonts
  * review Fluid APIs
  * simple notification audio
  * port to B2G

#### misc

  * play with Google closure compiler linting

#### open-web (WebRT) features we got for free from Fluid:
  * opacity of around 75%

  * make window appear in all spaces
  * explicit default height & width
